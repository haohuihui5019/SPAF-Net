# Uncertainty-Driven Semi-Supervised Learning for Phenology-Aware Apple Flower Counting

Official implementation of our uncertainty-driven semi-supervised learning framework for apple flower counting with phenological awareness.

Pretrained model evaluation code is available now, full implementation will be released upon paper acceptance.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel semi-supervised learning approach for accurate apple flower counting in agricultural monitoring systems. The method leverages:
- **Phenological temporal dependencies** for robust feature learning
- **Uncertainty-aware consistency regularization** for effective semi-supervision
- **Dual-branch architecture** for simultaneous counting and uncertainty estimation
## ðŸ”’ Code Availability
*We appreciate your understanding in maintaining research integrity during the peer review process. Please watch this repository for updates!*

**Currently released:**  
âœ… Pretrained model inference code  
âœ… Test set evaluation script (`predict tree-tree mse.py`)

**To be released after paper publication:**  
ðŸ”œ Full training implementation  
ðŸ”œ Semi-supervised learning framework
